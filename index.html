<h3 id="subtitle">The role of Communication Design in dismantling online universality.  </h3>

<div id="essay"> 
    
<p id="par1">In 1949, George Orwell wrote a dystopian novel called <i>Nineteen Eighty-Four</i>, describing a world governed by authoritarian regimes. The United Kingdom, now known as Airstrip One, collapsed into the hands of a totalitarian party that used the police and the media to manipulate and track citizens, suppressing individuality and critical thinking. As a result, the Party was able to develop "uniformity of opinion on all subjects” (Orwell, 1949, p.235), reflecting on the absolute obedience of society to the State. In this world, the media not only served as an agent of disinformation and coercion, but also as a means of feeding propaganda to individuals, to the point that no one had to write or talk as a form of expression. Therefore, both sharing thoughts and writing became obsolete and reprimanded activities,and if detected, they "would be punished by death." (Orwell, 1949, p.9). Accordingly, when the main character dares to pick up a pen to write in a diary for the first time in a long time, it felt foreign to him. “The pen was an archaic instrument" (Orwell, 1949, p.9), described as nearly impossible to find, and the act of marking the paper triggered a "tremor [to] go through his vowels."(Orwell, 1949, p.9) Geoge Orwell describes total acceptance as Orthodoxy. As the name indicates, it is the state of normality, one in which the conventional and the common are completely embraced. And, in its extreme, it means not thinking altogether. Once people conform to the information they receive without raising any questions, there is no need for thinking, no need to remain mindful of the world around them. Therefore, "Orthodoxy is unconsciousness"(Orwell, 1949, p.61), is never being sufficiently aware to question. At first, this story might seem purely allegorical, a dystopian future that never came true. But looking closely, there are some undeniable similarities to the reality we live in today.  </p>

<p id="par2">On the 6 of August of 1991, the World Wide Web went live to the world and quickly changed human routines. It promised an easy interface that would allow everyone to browse the web. By the late 1990s and early 2000s, It had caught the interest of companies that used it to sell their products, like eBay or Amazon, or individuals who saw in blogs an opportunity to share content for a wider audience. But it was not until 2004 and the Web 2.0 launch that it acquired its current status. The World Wide Web was now a social network, one where people could form friendships and connections through comments and like buttons, even with someone they had never seen before. Similarly, reading online became the new preferred way of getting information. With "hyperlinks and search engines" delivering "an endless supply of words on the screen, along with images, sounds, and videos" (Carr, 2010), the idea of having the world a click away was too appealing. From there, an endless number of devices and apps started appearing and suddenly, the internet was no longer just on a stay at home computer. On January 9 of 2007, Apple presented the IPhone to the world, and next to its picture was the phrase “Your life in your pocket.” But at the time, not even Steve Jobs could have predicted the effect of a smartphone on people's everyday habits, and their ability to reinforce the digital status in our lives while, along the way, driving psychological and cognitive shifts.</p>

<p id="par3">The continuous link to electronic devices has changed how knowledge is stored inside our brains. In addition to free access to overloads of content, we have not had to practise our memory to remember dates or read books. We take for granted having all knowledge in the palm of our hands. We demand knowing what is happening on the other side of the globe the second it happens. And anything that does not fall within those standards is put aside. Printed books now have to compete with digital versions, the ebooks, in which readers jump to the content they need instantly, and newspapers are no longer the first source of information, replaced by small articles that we find on our social media feed. Writing is mostly digital, in the form of emails, text messages, or short statements with a maximum of 280 characters, shared on social media. As a consequence, our brain is no longer used to concentrate on anything longer than these formats, and when confronted with it, it prefers skimming. Between 2006 and 2008, Don Tapscott and his company nGenera Corporation conducted a study in which they interviewed nearly 6,000 <i>Net Geners</i>, a title given to the generation that grew up surrounded by digital media, to evaluate the effects of internet use on the young, and found a preference for skipping around the text instead of reading linearly. But it was not only the younger who experienced a decrease in their attention span. It also affected those who grew up reading books and newspapers. Nicholas Carr describes his own experience in <i>The Shallows: How The Internet Is Changing The Way We Think, Read and Remember.</i> He notes that the way his "brain worked seemed to be changing" (Carr, 2010, p.16). At first, he thought the lack of brainpower was a middle-age symptom, but soon, he realized that it "wasn't just drifting," it was "hungry" and "demanding to be fed the way the Net fed it" (Carr, 2010, p.16), quickly and thoroughly. The brain was not prepared for this change in such a short period of time that it began coming up with reading processes that allows it to go through lots of content at once. One of them is fast-reading in which the reader only superficially goes through the text, skipping around a couple of paragraphs, in order to understand its general idea. Reading became a form of getting updates on what goes on around the world, and since the internet is so vast, there is always a lot to choose from. Most of the time, this is done in a passive state where the information is not understood but rather devoured without any processing moment or the creation of an opinion about the words. It demonstrates, therefore, the lack of dedication that people currently have to knowledge, which could eventually lead to the eventual degradation of our critical thinking.</p>

<p id="par4">Power structures are aware of these struggles and exploit it to their advantage by resorting to unclear, idiomatic language or metaphorical statements. This way, the edges of the truth may be blurred, and public perception of a certain subject may slowly change. And since everyone is too distracted by the endless wonders of the internet, these statements go by unnoticed, without any opposition or request for clarification. George Orwell had already studied this phenomenon back in 1943. In his essay titled <i>Politics And The English Language</i>, he exposed the relationship between Power and language, calling out political discourse as an act of misinformation, and noting a tendency for the usage of "stale metaphors, similes, and idioms"(Orwell, 1943, p.7) to cover the real meaning of a statement. </p>

<p id="par5">Unfortunately, as we see in the written and spoken language, in graphics, we can also find traces of doublespeak. There are many examples throughout history where Communication Design had a direct impact on the production of content that would alter the perception of society on historical events. One of those is the propaganda produced for the nazi party that rulled Germany between 1934 to 1945. During this time, Communication Design was an ally of the Communist party, and ended up promoting their ideas through designed propaganda. The campaigns created a false illusory of the ideal world ruled by the Party, using audacious typefaces and engaging photographic compositions. In <i>Mein Kampf</i>, Adolf Hitler gave clear insight on the role of Design while producing political content: “The art of propaganda consists precisely in being able to awaken the imagination of the public through an appeal to their feelings, in finding the appropriate psychological form that will arrest the attention and appeal to the hearts of the national masses.” (Hitler, 1939) In this context, Design, as a discipline with knowledge of how color and typography can manipulate the emotions of the viewers, was the main tool for producing misleading images that turned people’s attention away from the atrocities going on behind the scenes. </p>

<p id="par6">There was, however, a time when the discipline strived for neutrality and a complete withdrawal from political positions. Functionalism, a movement within the modernist era, and prominent in the first half of the twentieth century, was an aesthetic philosophy that evaluated the success of a design piece according to its ability to achieve its function. It argued that good Design would have no taste, no opinion, so it called for the removal of any unsustained decoration that could express the designer’s taste and bias. The most exponential example of a style that follows this philosophy would be the International Typographic Style of the 50s, which valued the power of mathematics and grids to create impartiality to the content represented. Around this time, the predilected typeface was Helvetica, a font that wanted to emulate rationality and the "need to make things more democratic" (Helvetica, 2007). Its construction followed strict rules and structures, creating a serene font family where each character resembled the previous so there were no particular letters that would stand out. It soon became the “symbol of progressive design with a flavour of objectivity” (Pater, 2017, p.53) which only prompted the interest of businesses and corporate culture. Since then, many other typefaces emerged, wanting to appear neutral. Especially with the rise of reading through screens, there was a greater need for typefaces that were "transparent to the reader" (Haley, 2020), as they are considered to be the best in terms of legibility. In an essay titled <i>The Crystal Goblet</i>, Beatrice Warde, an American typographic expert who was the publicity manager for the Monotype Corporation and editor of the Monotype Recorder and Newsletter, compares typography and its content to a song in an unknown language. She writes that, while listening to foreign music, the brain disconnects from the search for meaning and focuses solely on the pleasure of the melody. In an equal exercise, "Type well used is invisible as type," becoming an "unnoticed vehicle for the transmission of words." (Warde, 1930, p.2) </p>

<p id="par7">By looking at recent examples of the implementation of typography in brand identities or political campaigns, we find examples of the opposite. For instance, looking at the new logo for Facebook, unveiled in November of 2019, it is clear the usage of design to deviate the attention of the public from the flaws of the company. Facebook commissioned a custom typeface that uses some of the modernist strategies to evoke clarity, while the company was under investigation for secretly selling user's data to third parties, and empathy, when their social platforms were widely known for deteriorating young people's mental health. Another example is Gotham, a typeface created in 2000 by the American type designers Tobias Frere-Jones and Jesse Ragan. The first characterized the font as "not the kind of letter a type designer would make" but one "an engineer would" (Helvetica, 2007) since its shape was deeply inspired by the utilitarian aesthetic of Manhattan's architecture. However, during the process of creating this typeface, they could have never imagined it would be implemented on the 2008 Obama’s Presidential Campaign and again, a couple of years later in the UK, on printed slogans in favor of Brexit. Since these two campaigns have such clashing views on several social issues, one of them being emigration, it shows that neutrality has been used as an excuse to create ambiguous typefaces. A movement deprived of style and position could easily become a case of doublespeak, therefore raising the question on the role of functionalism and its ideals within the discipline. In this context, Design should consider its close relationship with power, one in which it has conceded and further refined techniques for the development of ambiguous misleading visuals that manipulate public opinion.</p>
    


<p id="par8">Still, the practice that allies with soft power should be the same that uncovers it. Throughout history, Design has claimed that it uses universal and democratic language to communicate the message as objectively as possible. As the previous cases show, that is not always the truth. Communication is a “volatile process” (Pater, 2017, p.3), Especially in today's social media networking society of global platforms where different cultures come together in one place. More than ever, Communication needs to be precise in its goals so there is no possibility for missed communication between all these networks. And Design must be the one to expose cases in which terms such as “universal” or “objective” are used loosely, especially within its own practice. Tony Fry, a design theorist and philosopher argues that Design "either serves or subverts the status quo" (Fry, 2007, p.88). After all, the same knowledge of typography, composition, or color that is used to deceive, could be an asset when it comes to investigating and uncovering cases of visual doublespeak. </p>

<p id="par9">There are plenty of examples of designers that took this role. One of them is Metahaven, founded by graphic designers and writers Vinca Kruk and Daniel van Velder in 2007. As a research and design collective based in Amsterdam, they use design as a form of analyzing the current social context and produce objects that provoke social empowerment and political change. They believe that designers "have agency," therefore "can choose what it is they want to do, with whom to work with, and form alliances. Not just in terms of defending their political views but also their rights" (Metahaven, 2020). That stance clearly reflects on their work. In <i>Uncorporate Identity</i>, Metahaven collaborated with Marina Vishmidth to create a book that brings to light governments' use of soft power. They question the need to brand cities and countries as if they were an entity that sells goods. At the same time, they hope to alert the public to the lack of accountability involved in the development of these corporate identities, thus demonstrating how these relations have become standardised, transparent and unquestioned. They believe, as designers, they have "a keen eye for the psychology of font use, color use, and drop shadows'' (Metahaven, 2014), which translates into an ample awareness of the hidden role of the images created. In the end, they bring their intuition and expertise into a detailed analysis that uncovers the visual and design techniques utilised by the state's branding. The finished product is not simple or pleasant to look at. Its design represents the seriousness and complexity of the content, which directly reflected on the typographic choices and stylistic elements. The book, therefore, communicates not only through its content, but also through the designer’s stylistic choices.</p>

<p id="par10">The use of the medium as a means of communication itself is a topic which has long been studied in the field of communication design. One of the main inspirations for this practice is <i>The Medium is The Massage</i>, a book from 1967, in which Marshall McLuhan reflects on the impact of media in society. He was worried about the new advances in technology, at the time the television and film, to manipulate and distract the audience. He concluded that the "nature of the media" has a more ample impact in societies than  "the content of the communication" (McLuhan and Fiore, 1967, p.8) so, in the long run, a medium’s content would matter less than the medium itself. People have more confidence in what they feel and see than written ideas, so much so that "we call our wisest men visionaries, or seers" (McLuhan and Fiore, 1967, p.8). Therefore, McLuhan figured that the new technological mediums were at an advantage standpoint than their previous, such as the printed media, since they demanded involvement, attention. They were not just background noise,they provoked emotional interactions, a personal connection. The current digital devices take their demands to a new level. The internet requests far greater attention than the television ever did since it needs inputs from our senses, such as the touch to click and scroll through the screen, or the visual that allows us to navigate online. And while we are lost in this world, with all the information being fed to us, we are oblivious to the deceiving practices done behind the scenes. </p>

<p id="par11">In order to counteract this situation, it is important to use new forms of displaying information that better captivate people's attention and enable them to think critically. In this case, for all its negative effects, there are undeniable advantages in understanding the connection between interactiveness and the human brain, so it could be reverted and used in a more ethical form. However, to do so, we need to consider the full degree to which our minds have become slaves to technology, and then plan a solution to turn our willpower around. Well-intentioned interaction could in fact, be a better form of communication, since it requires the brain to indulge in the experience, making the retention of information much faster than simply reading. Communication Design should then take advantage of the interaction with the medium instead of simply creating more content that visually explains the concept of double speak. As we have seen before, the internet is already saturated with content that consumers have little control over. So Design needs to focus on mediums that are better suited for the modern cognitive demands in order to get the message across.</p>

<p id="par12">In this context, we could look at Graphic Design &'s work. <i>In The Other Side: An Emotional Map of Great Britain,</i> the London-based design publisher created a book that came as a personal response to the result of the 2016 United Kingdoms’ referendum on staying or leaving the European Union. The intention of the partnership consisting of Lucienne Roberts and Rebecca Wright was to use graphic design as a language to examine and question the situation they were experiencing. As the former frames it in an interview for the Aiga Eye on Design, “it started from a sense of real grief” (Roberts,2020). They intended to have a neutral position, representing fairly both sides and allow each person interviewed to expose their points. As Rebecca Wright suggests, that is the “one thing that was missing in the media: people weren’t given the opportunity to just pause and reflect” (Wright, 2020). So in this book, they used graphic design to create a space that gives an equal opportunity for the two sides to present their reasons. For example, the layout builds a double-ended book that comes together at the center, while the various typefaces implemented identify each speaker’s region, serving as an individualizer of the different voices. On the other hand, the way designers demonstrate their perspective is also crucial for its development. In this case, the implementation of graphic design is, in itself, a form of demonstrating a position to the reader. Starting from the layout, the physical interaction provoked by the flip of the book allows the user to get an insight into the opposing ideas represented. Yet, when it comes together at the centre, Roberts and Wright show that their intentions were not to accentuate the divide, but to use “graphic design’s potential for reconciliation” (Morley, 2020). Similarly, Communication Design should take advantage of today’s preferred medium, the internet, to create platforms where users can interact with elements of Communication Design. In order for them to understand that the connection of meaning with images is more complex than they might have expected, the process of stylistic decisions has to be unveiled. Only then Communication Design becomes truly democratic.</p>

<p id="par13">The internet, and its possibility to engage the users, could become an ally in uncovering cases of visual doublespeak, as opposed to contributing to perpetuating the idea of the medium deceiving perception. In an interview for <i>The Verge,</i> Oliver Reichenstein, founder and director of Information Architects, asserted that “good design needs to be invisible” so that users have “minimal conscious thoughts” when using an interface (Reichenstein, 2012). The implementation of Modernist values creates a supposed universal network, but ultimately only serves to capture the consumer to a content-feeding system where there is no agency, no will. The internet and its interface have become another passive intermediate of content, one that has shown to conspire with Power to shape people’s opinion without them knowing. And the way content is presented to the reader has played a leading role. It should therefore be the duty of Design to redefine this space by coming up with solutions where users can interact with communication design elements, so that they are able to understand to what degree the many possibilities for presenting information could have an effect on the understanding of a message. </p>
    
<p id="par14">One great example of such a platform is the <i>Space Type Generator</i> by Kiel Danger Mutschelknaus, an online interactive website where anyone can create experimental animated typography, then transform them into personal pieces of moving graphics. In very plain terms, it is a tool that allows users to create forms out of type. But it goes beyond. It uses interactivity as a form of engagement to construct an environment where people can play with the elements they see on the screen. In the meantime, however, the consumer generates their own content by combining typography with colour and movement, shaping their own versions to make them more personal, not just passively accepting the content that someone previously created for them. </p>

<p id="par15">Now the designer is not the one who produces visual content to illustrate a particular topic. In this case, the designer is the one who encourages, and probably creates the interaction between the user and the elements of Communication Design, so that people can shape their own opinions without interference. In an interview for the <i>It's Nice That</i>, Kiel states that "the future (or a future) of design is in the creation of tools rather than the creation of the designs" (Mutschelknaus, 2019). This is a topic that many have been discussing within the field since coming up with easy visuals to bring awareness to a subject seems to have become irrelevant in a world drowned by images. There needs to be a shift in both the approach taken when presenting information, and the way designers view the public. There is a broad common belief within the discipline that the goal should be to produce "easy design" that someone without any knowledge of communication would be able to understand. This meant the creation of blatant interfaces for users to follow, or easy layouts for readers to skim through. However, the opposite should be happening. Design should encourage the user to slow down and internalise what's in front of them. To experiment and interact with communication elements and witness how they work. By doing so, they will understand the influence of typography and images, as well as the many ways they have been used unethically. Perhaps, it will broaden the horizons of what is considered to be Communication Design in order to allocate the creation of methods and tools as a form of design making. What is certain, however, is that it will establish a more democratic practise in which everyone can participate, particularly in an open-source online context where people from many fields of expertise can share knowledge.</p>
    


<p id="par16">The same techniques should be applied to typography in order to build a more customised experience with the content, as the so-called “neutral typography” does not offer many benefits to the understanding of the content. Although they increase reading speed, especially the velocity at which words are understood by the brain, they could exacerbate confusion and end up being used in doublespeak contexts. Communication Design should, instead, think of ways to create a truly objective system of representing a message in all its nuances. For example, if the content being translated is a speech, it could be useful to create a method of representing both the message and the intonation of the voice. Intonation is a form of communication that transmits personal attitudes and emotions. When used simultaneously with the verbal language, which happens most times during conversations, it can influence the meaning of a message. Therefore, it is important for the reader to understand the full spectrum of the content by having access to both its verbal and non verbal components. Another possibility would be the representation, through the shape of the typeface, the person or context in which the words were spoken. Someone's character or personal journey could give a broader explanation of the reasoning behind a statement. So it could be useful for the reader to have access to those elements in order to fully comprehend the message as a whole.</p>
    


<p id="par17">Another example is <i>Meta-The-Difference-Between-The-Two-Font</i>, a typeface created by Dexter Sinister in 2010 using MetaFont, a computer typographic system built in 1979 by Donald Knuth. The latter, as a mathematician, designed the software based on mathematical equations, making the development of typefaces more a task for a math expert than a designer. This could explain why only a handful of typefaces have ever come out of the program. However, while presenting the concept of “Mathematical Typography” to the American Mathematical Society on July 4 of 1978, he characterized it as a work-in-progress rather than a completed research. It was indeed a long journey that lasted 10 years and, along the way he perfected the way typography is set, which still has an enormous impact in how we do it today. <i>Meta-The-Difference-Between-The-Two-Font</i> takes inspiration from this process and has a similar “incomplete character” (Sinister, 2011, p.34). The idea was to use this font as a form of iteration in which its shape, which starts from a simple skeleton, evolves through making, editing or writing. The final result is a “growing family” of fonts whose form reflects the clumsy attempt of the computer-automated system to reproduce handwritten calligraphy. But still, its evolution illustrates “the complicated, digressive, discursive, even meandering backstory of how it came to be what it is.” (Reinfurt, 2019)</p>

<p id="par18">Typography should not try to be universal, as if one size fits all. Just the opposite. It needs to convey, through its form, the position of what is written and translate the message in its entirety, without any hidden meaning or possibility of missed interpretations. Additionally, it should not be static. Instead, it must take into account the complexities of the context portrayed and be able to allocate its inevitable evolution. The reading experience should have a similar process. The aim of Communication Design should not be to create a universal standardised experience. Instead, It should be about making sure the reader can comprehend the full extent of the message. However, that is only possible once people have more time to read. Only then the process becomes about understanding the message on a deeper level, and a way for the brain to make connections to previous knowledge. This will reflect on a deeper interaction with the content, one that is unique to the reader. In the book <i>The Gutenberg Elegies: The Fate Of Reading In An Electronic Age,</i> Sven Birkerts writes about the importance of slowing down reading as a form of freedom. The necessity of having personal control and adapting the experience to the particular needs and rhythms of a person. And in the digital context, where the medium has been used for the advantage of power structures, it could be the beginning of gaining back our consciousness by learning to control our online experience.</p>

<p id="par19">The individualisation of the display of information on the screen can now easily be achieved since there have been many developments in coding languages which emphasise the interaction with on-screen elements. Hence, there is no excuse for a standardised practice of online reading. Society has uncritically accepted  a “neutral looking” communication as the status quo, in which everyone has the same needs, the same reading abilities. That is simply not the truth. Everyone has conflicting demands that render a universal reading experience completely useless. Some people feel more engaged in trendy typefaces and colours than others who would rather read on a more toned down display. So how does a text in Times New Roman in a white background allocate both these preferences?</p>

<p id="par20">Furthermore, the use of equal layout and typographic treatment for every single piece of text on the screen has perpetuated the need to read more quickly, without actually understanding what is in front of our eyes. A children's tale could easily have the same visual treatment as news of a deadly virus, which is a reflection of the lack of  visual clues that could allow skimmers to discern what sort of information they are about to devour. This causes an unconscious passiveness towards what we read that, in the long run, could be detrimental for the making of rational informed decisions and, ultimately, a threat to a democratical society. In order to prevent this scenario from taking place, the Internet should make it possible for each user to be able to personalise the display of information in order to better match their reading preferences. Through doing so it encourages readers to have a deeper relation to the content, one in which they would have to take the time to learn how it could be tailored to them, and not the other way around. The longer process would also be an attempt to slow down the reading experience and establish closer connections with written words. The material would not be simply something else people go through, it would have a meaningful effect on someone's knowledge. </p>

<p id="par21">But most importantly, this sort of experience could get internet users to question what is universality, neutrality or legibility. How formal changes directly impact the meaning of the message, or even, what makes a text seem more or less truthful. Since these issues directly affect society's perception and understanding of the world, a global debate on their impact should take place, not just within Design. As a discipline that has been dealing with these subjects throughout its history, it could give important guidance and insight in that discussion. However it is only by experimenting with these elements on their own that people can understand the full extent of the effect. Therefore, in this context, Communication Design should not be making stylistic decisions or facilitating the experience of the reader. On the contrary, it should generate tension in the reader's mind by coming up with experiences in which people are halted in their pursuit of superficial reading. At the same time, Design should allow everybody to think about the effect of visual communication on information, so that there is more visual literacy. Only then we are able to oppose the relationship between power structures and the internet, as well as build an environment free of deceiving language that is truly objective and efficiently informative.</p>
